USER MANUAL
After insmoding  the submiter_test.ko, it will create a proc file at /proc/submiter/submiter_entry. 
Echo args to the file could submit bio to our device. 

The echo args will like: 
lba bvector_number and followed by each vectors offset and length, separated by space. 

Example:
If I want to send a bio the device (default is /dev/memdiska) at lba 128, the bio has 3 bvecs. 
	the first bvec: offset 0, len 512
	the second bvec: offset 512, len 1024 
	the first bvec: offset 1024, len 3072 
I could use this command:
	echo 128 3 0 512 512 1024 1024 3072 > /proc/submiter/submiter_entry

Two bios will be submited to the device, first write data to device, then read out and compare. 
If errors happen or data dismatch, the echo command will return error, 
   and detail information could be found in "dmesg".

A quick script is also create. You could just edit the data.txt file, write each bio's information, 
then run submit.sh, the script will read the data.txt and echo each line to /proc/submiter/submiter_entry.
